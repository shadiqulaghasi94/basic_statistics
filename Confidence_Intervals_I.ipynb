    "A [confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval) is an estimate computed from observed data's statistics. A CI is a range of values we are fairly sure our true value lies within. We can say: we are 99% certain (confidence *level*) that most of these datasets (confidence *intervals*) contain the true population parameter. Several tests can be done to determine the CIs:\n",
    "1. **Z-score**: it shows us how many standard deviations we are away from the mean of a distribution. For example, in investing, Z-scores are measures of an observation's variability and can be put to use by traders in determining market volatility. \n",
    "2. **t-score**: it allows you to take one score and standardize it which then enables you to compare it to other scores. The t-score determines the ratio of differences between two groups or samples, as well as the differences within a group or sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the **z-score** is used when the sample size, $N$, is $N\\geq30$, while **t-test** is used otherwise. In some situations even with samples more than 30 the data may be non-normal. Also in that case, the z-test should be preferred."

In other words, we set a target probability $r$ and we look for the value $z_r$ such that we get that probability. For example, for a standard normal distribution, we can say that to be 90% sure that our mean is zero, the sample mean $\\hat{x}$ must fall in [-1.645, 1.645].
